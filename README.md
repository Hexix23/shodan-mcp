### Integration Options

SHODAN-MCP can be integrated with various AI and development environments:

#### ü§ñ Claude Integration

Claude can interact with SHODAN-MCP using the MCP protocol:

1. In Claude Desktop, go to Settings ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí Edit Config
2. Edit the `claude_desktop_config.json` file and add the following configuration:

   ```json
   "mcpServers": {
     "shodan": {
       "command": "/path/to/uv",
       "args": [
         "--directory",
         "/path/to/shodan-mcp/shodan-mcp-server",
         "run",
         "shodan_mcp.py"
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

3. Replace `/path/to/uv` with your actual path to the uv executable (e.g., `~/.local/bin/uv` on macOS/Linux)
4. Replace `/path/to/shodan-mcp` with the actual path to your shodan-mcp project directory
5. Save the configuration and restart Claude
6. Now you can ask Claude to use Shodan tools directly in your conversations

#### üñ•Ô∏è Cursor IDE Integration

[Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) seamlessly integrates with SHODAN-MCP:

1. Open Cursor preferences (‚åò+,)
2. Navigate to "Extensions" > "MCP Tools"
3. Click "Add MCP Tool" and provide:
   - Name: `shodan`
   - Command: `/path/to/uv`
   - Arguments: `--directory,/path/to/shodan-mcp/shodan-mcp-server,run,shodan_mcp.py`
4. Replace paths with your actual uv and shodan-mcp locations
5. Save and restart Cursor
6. Use the command palette (‚åò+Shift+P) and type "MCP: Shodan" to access tools

#### üìù VSCode Integration

For VSCode users, add the following to your settings.json file:

1. Open VS Code settings (‚åò+Shift+P, then type "Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)")
2. Add the following configuration:

   ```json
   "mcp": {
     "inputs": [],
     "servers": {
       "shodan": {
         "command": "/path/to/uv",
         "args": [
           "--directory",
           "/path/to/shodan-mcp/shodan-mcp-server",
           "run",
           "shodan_mcp.py"
         ],
         "env": {}
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Replace `/path/to/uv` with your actual path to the uv executable (e.g., `~/.local/bin/uv` on macOS/Linux or the full path on Windows)
4. Replace `/path/to/shodan-mcp` with the actual path to your shodan-mcp project directory
5. Save the settings and restart VS Code
6. Access through the built-in AI features or command palette

### Installation with UV

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is recommended for managing Python environments and dependencies due to its speed and reliability:

```bash
# Install uv if you don't have it
curl -sSf https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/download/0.1.21/uv-installer.sh | sh

# Install project dependencies with uv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the MCP server with uv
uv --directory /path/to/shodan-mcp/shodan-mcp-server run shodan_mcp.py
```

| **Docker** | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Support planned but not yet implemented |
| **Cloud** | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Support planned but not yet tested |

> Note: This project has been primarily developed and tested on macOS and Linux environments. Contributions to expand and test compatibility on other platforms are welcome!

## üîß Technical Architecture

SHODAN-MCP is built using:
- **FastMCP**: High-performance async framework for API interactions
- **Shodan API Client**: Official Python client for Shodan
- **HTTPX**: Modern asynchronous HTTP client
- **Python-dotenv**: For secure environment variable management
- **MCP Protocol**: For seamless integration with AI assistants

The system uses an asynchronous architecture to provide high-performance, non-blocking API interactions, enabling efficient processing of multiple requests simultaneously.

## üîë API Key Management

SHODAN-MCP uses the Shodan API key stored in a `.env` file in the project root. This approach keeps your API key secure and separate from the code.

1. **Get an API key**: Sign up at [Shodan](https://account.shodan.io/) to obtain your API key
2. **Create .env file**: Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:
   ```
   SHODAN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` to prevent your API key from being uploaded to public repositories. The project automatically loads the API key from this file using the python-dotenv library.

> **Security note**: Never share your Shodan API key or include it in files that might be uploaded to public repositories.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Ethics

This tool is designed for legitimate security research and defensive purposes. Users are responsible for ensuring they comply with:

- Applicable laws and regulations
- Shodan's terms of service
- Ethical standards for security research

Always obtain proper authorization before scanning or analyzing systems you don't own.

## üìö Usage Notes

- Some commands consume Shodan API credits (see [Shodan pricing](https://account.shodan.io/billing))
- Results provide comprehensive intelligence for analysis
- Data is presented in a structured, readable format
- Advanced formatting instructions ensure clarity of technical details
- For bulk operations, consider using the async batch methods to optimize performance

## üîÆ Upcoming Features

The following features are planned for future releases:

- **Markdown Report Generation**: Automatically create comprehensive reports in Markdown format for all queries
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple queries in parallel for improved efficiency
- **Advanced Visualization**: Visual representations of search results and networks
- **Docker Container**: Ready-to-use containerized version for easier deployment
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Expanded testing and support for Windows and other platforms
